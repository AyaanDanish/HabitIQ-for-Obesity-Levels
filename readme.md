#### What does each attribute mean?
The dataset comprises 17 attributes, including: Eating habits, Physical condition, Demographic information The target variable: NObesity (Obesity Level), which categorizes individuals into:Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II,Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, Obesity Type III
#### For what purpose was the dataset created?
The dataset was created to estimate obesity levels in individuals based on their eating habits and physical condition. It is suitable for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.
#### Are there missing values?
No
#### Does the dataset contain metadata, e.g., a README file?
The UCI repository entry provides a brief overview of the dataset but does not include a comprehensive README file or detailed metadata.
#### Short Description:
This dataset contains information on obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions, collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. It includes 2111 instances and 17 features, with the target variable NObesity categorizing individuals into seven obesity levels. The dataset can be used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks and is publicly available under a CC BY license.

## 2. Decision-Making Scenario

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
### Stakeholder list:
- Patient, user 
- Nutritionist or Trainer
- ML expert

### Stakeholder Patient, User:
#### Stakeholder Knowledge:
- Limited technical knowledge.
- Basic understanding of health and nutrition.
- Personal insight into their own habits and lifestyle.

#### Goals:
- To achieve a normal weight
- To become fit and healthy

#### Objectives:
- Be informed about their own current status.
- Be self-aware of the factors that affect obesity the most.
- Achieve a specific weight based on your demographics.
- Achieve nutrition goals based on recommendations, like eating more vegetables.
- Receive personalized recommendations on current habits to change in order to reach a normal weight.

#### Tasks:
- Prepare Complete information to the Nutritionist or Trainer.
- Follow the directions of the Nutritionist or Trainer.
-Attend follow-up sessions and track progress.

#### Key Questions:
- Is my data safe and private?
- Can I trust this system's recommendations?

### Stakeholder Nutritionist or Trainer:
#### Stakeholder Knowledge:
- Deep understanding of physical health and dietary science.
Goals:
- Easily use the model and give Smart suggestions.
- Understand the model well enough to interpret results confidently.

#### Objectives:
-Understand how the results are structured and be able to find flaws/errors of the model.
-Be aware of the model’s feature importance.
- Mix his own domain knowledge with the model recommendations and give a proper suggestion.
- Customize the model to the patients personal characteristics.

#### Tasks:
- Gather patients’ or users’ inputs and input them to the system.
- Combine his knowledge with the model and give proper suggestions.
- Personalize recommendations by his knowledge and model output.

#### Key Questions:
- How reliable is this recommendation?
- What features most influenced this suggestion?
- Can I override the system’s advice if I disagree?

### Stakeholder ML expert:
#### Stakeholder Knowledge:
-Strong technical understanding of ML/AI, algorithms, and model evaluation.
-Has limited domain knowledge in nutrition or physical fitness.

#### Goals:
- Create a robust, fair, and interpretable model
- Ensure the system has real-world impact and commercial value.

#### Objectives:
-Make an accurate model that can be well interpreted.
-Build a UI/UX friendly Model for non technical people.
- Make and sell the product.
- Gather feedback about performance of model in action.

#### Tasks:
- Train and Test the Model.
- Make a proper explanation and presentation for users.
- UI and UX design.
- Fine-tune the model based on feedback and design a mechanism for it.

#### Key Questions:
- Is the model biased toward certain groups?
- Which features most influence predictions?
- How should I communicate uncertainties to users?
